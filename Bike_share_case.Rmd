# Introduction
![Bike_sharing](https://miro.medium.com/max/586/1*ddC1KfTAHBXjmGseS2drRw.png)
This is a Capstone Project for Google Data Analytics Professional Certification.

Cyclistic is a bike-share company with flexibility in its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Users who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders, and customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Cick here [link](https://divvybikes.com/)

I will be using the 6 phases of the analysis process (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share and Act) to help guide my analysis of the data sets.

# **Phase 1: Ask.**

#### 1. **Identify the business task:**
  1. Analyze ride trends of **member** and **casual** users.
  2. Provide high quality recommendations for Cyclistic’s marketing strategy.

####    **Questions to guide analysis.**

1. ¿How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. ¿How to make more attractive the membership program than the casual one?
3. ¿How can these trends help influence Cyclistic marketing strategy?

  
####  2.  **Consider key stakeholders.**
**Primary stakeholders:**

* Lily Moreno - Director of marketing
* Cyclistic executive team

**Secondary Stakeholders:**

* Cyclistic marketing analytics team
* Cyclistic’s finance analysts

# **Phases 2: Prepare.**
**1. Identify the data source:**

Dataset: Cyclistic’s historical trip data (click here to access the dataset [link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)), has information about 
Cyclistic historical trip data (Note: The datasets have a different name because 
Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, 
the datasets are appropriate and will enable for answering the business questions. 
The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

This is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are 
using Cyclistic bikes. But note that data-privacy issues prohibit you from using
riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that you won’t be able to 
connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live 
in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.

For this case study, the information that shall be used is historical trip data 
from April 2019 to March 2020.

**2. Determine the credibility of the data**

The **¨ROCCC** system shall be used to determine the credibility and integrity 
of the data.

**Reliability:** The information is reliable because is complete and accurate,
it has a lot of information about trips performed in several years.

* Validity: The data is corrected stored in the right place, click [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). 
* Completeness: It includes the necessary and basic information in order 
to complete the analysis. 
* Uniqueness: It is free from duplicates and only 
provided by the right link.

**originality:** Low, the data is provided by a third-party called Motivate 
International Inc. 

**Comprehensive:** The data includes everything that is needed to perform the 
analysis.

**Current:** The data is updated monthly, but for this study it will only be 
used from April 2019 to March 2020.

**Cited:**  The Data set was created by Divvy company which is a credible 
organization and it was last refreshed in 2022, However it is collected by a 
third party.

The data integrity and credibility is sufficient to provide reliable and 
comprehensive insights to Cyclistic. With the data, analysis on how customer and 
casual riders behave differently can be performed.

**3. Information about the data**

* For this capstone project, the analysis shall be performed between
April 219 to March 2020.
* It is structured data gotten from and external source.
* It has continuous and discrete variables.
* It is quantitative.
* Data is organized in rows and columns.

**4. About data ethics aspects**

* The information has been made available by third party company **Motivate International Inc.** under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). 
Data-privacy issues prohibit people from using riders’ personally identifiable 
information. This means that people won’t be able to connect pass purchases to 
credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the
Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.
* The data sets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company.

**5. About the data source**

* The data will provide insights about riders behavior regarding both services 
and will provide a conclusion on how to make it more profitable by increasing 
annual members.
* Data set has information about trips, start and end date of the ride, 
where the ride started and where it finalized, name of the stations and if it is
a member or a casual rider.
* For this project the following information shall not be taken into consideration:
  * trip_id.
  * rideable_type.
  * from_station_id.
  * from_station_name.
  * to_station_id.
  * to_station_name.
  * gender.
  * birthyear.
  
# **Phases 3: Process**

####### Installing requires packages.
* tidyverse for data processing.
* lubridate for processing data and times.
* ggplot2 for visualization.

```{r include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
```

####### Displays working directory
```{r results='hide'}
getwd()
```
####### sets your working directory to simplify calls to data
```{r echo=FALSE}
setwd("c:/Users/osman/OneDrive/documents/") 
```

####### Upload data set.
```{r Upload Divvy datasets (csv files) here}
q2_2019 <- read.csv("Divvy_Trips_2019_Q2.csv")
q3_2019 <- read.csv("Divvy_Trips_2019_Q3.csv")
q4_2019 <- read.csv("Divvy_Trips_2019_Q4.csv")
q1_2020 <- read.csv("Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.csv")
```

####### Modifying column names of q2 to match q3 and q4
```{r Modifying column names of q2 to match q3 and q4}
colnames(q2_2019) <- c("trip_id", "start_time", "end_time", "bikeid", "tripduration",
                       "from_station_id", "from_station_name", "to_station_id", "to_station_name", 
                       "usertype","gender","birthyear")
```

######### Convert ride_id and rideable_type to character type so that they can stack correctly
######## q1 ride_id is already a character type.

```{r Convert ride_id and rideable_type to character type so that they can stack correctly}

# Phase 4 & 5: Analyze and share.

* From the first charts, indicates that, from April 2019 to March 2020, members 
took more trips than casual riders.
* In that period of time, casual riders took 393 300 trips (15%) meanwhile members
took 2 171 900 trips (85%) which is a huge difference in trips.
* Another insight from the first chart is that members use the bikes more 
during weekdays, 300 000 plus rides from Monday to Friday and drops to 180 000 plus Saturday and Sundays.

* Annual members paid around USD 10 per month, meanwhile, casual paid USD 1.00 
per single ride or USD 15.0 day per day for a single pass.

* Regarding the average time of the use of bikes, and from the second chart, 
it shows that trip average duration of casual riders (83.89%) is much much higher than 
the average trip duration of members (16.11%).

* It means members took more trips, however, casual trips duration is longer.
* From April 2019 to March 2020, the average trip duration is constant in casual
rides and it keeps between 3894 seconds and 4507 seconds and Mondays are the only
day that drops to around 2960 seconds per day.

### Recomendations

* To offer more hours per day to casual if upgraded to members.
* To set up a marketing campaign to convince casual riders of the great opportunity
of increasing the number of trips per day by becoming a member.
* To offer a discount on the membership price for a period of time to casuals who opt for the membership program.
